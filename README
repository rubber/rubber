The rubber plugin enables relatively complex multi-instance deployments to
Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).

If you just want a simple single instance setup for your rails app, you might
be better off using something like ec2onrails (which I borrowed heavily from).
The main difference between the two is that rubber was built from the
ground-up to support deploying to multiple instances, and has a very flexible
mechanism for configuring said instances at a host, role or global level.
That is, you can define a set of configuration files for a role, thereby making
it easy to create as many instance for that role as you desire (e.g. scaling up
the quantity of instances you need to host your app servers)

REQUIREMENTS:

* An EC2 account with keypair (both public and private keys)
    By default rubber _will_ configure your ec2 security groups for you
    See the EC2 docs for more details:
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2007-08-29/GettingStartedGuide/?ref=get-started
* amazon-ec2: "sudo gem install amazon-ec2"
* AWS::S3: "sudo gem install aws-s3"
* Capistrano: "sudo gem install capistrano"
* nettica gem: "sudo gem install nettica" if using nettica to auto map instances to A records

QUICK START:

You can follow these steps to create a demo app on a single
instance:

Create a simple rails project:
rails rubbertest
cd rubbertest
./script/generate scaffold post title:string body:text

Install rubber:
./script/plugin install http://rubber.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk
./script/generate vulcanize minimal_mysql

Configure rubber:
<edit config/rubber/rubber.yml>
For demo, you need real values for these:
  aws_access_key
  aws_secret_access_key
  aws_account
  ec2_key_name
  ec2_key_file

For a real app, you should go through all the settings in rubber.yml as well
as the settings in rubber-MODULE.yml which contains settings specific to
each MODULE (nginx, mongrel, etc)

Create, bootstrap, then deploy to instance:
ALIAS=production ROLES=web,app,mysql_master cap rubber:create
cap rubber:bootstrap
cap deploy:setup
cap deploy:cold

Then you should be able to browse to http://production.foo.com (uses
/etc/hosts file, so need to set your own domain for the demo)

As a convenience, you could instead run "cap rubber:create_staging" to
automate the above for a single instance.

For a more complex production setup

ALIAS=web01 ROLES=web cap rubber:create
ALIAS=app01 ROLES=app cap rubber:create
ALIAS=app02 ROLES=app cap rubber:create
ALIAS=db01 ROLES=mysql_master cap rubber:create
ALIAS=db02 ROLES=mysql_slave cap rubber:create
cap rubber:bootstrap
cap deploy:setup
cap deploy:cold

To add another app server to an existing deployment:

ALIAS=app03 ROLES=app cap rubber:create
cap rubber:bootstrap
cap deploy

INSTALLATION:

First, Rubber needs to be installed as a rails plugin.  Then run its
vulcanize generator to add a basic set of configuration files to your
project.

The vulcanize generator follows a mixin model.  You can choose to generate
a complete deployment scenario like "mysql_complete", or you can start with
the "base" or "mysql_minimal" generator and mixin in the modules you want for
your needs.  The goal here is to get people to contribute generators so that
we all don't have to reinvent the wheel every time we need to come up with a
deployment environment.  For example,

./script/generate vulcanize mysql_minimal
./script/generate vulcanize monit

to setup a minimal mysql setup (a stack made up of mysql, mongrel and nginx),
and add in monit for making sure your components stay running

Each component/stack will install a set of transformable config files, a
rubber-module.yml file for configuring their transformation, and a
deploy-module.rb file for doing the right thing for that module during
deployment.  I try to ensure that all components have sane defaults so
they will work out of the box, but you'll still want to peruse the files
they generate to customize their behavior.

Edit config/rubber/rubber*.yml to add your settings.  You can edit or
add to the config files in RAILS_ROOT/config/rubber/<common|role|host> to
transform those config files globally for all instances or for specific roles
and/or hosts.

You will also need to customize config/deploy.rb for your needs. The deployment
scripts in config/deploy-MODULE.yml contain MODULE specific (mongrel, nginx,
etc) scripts for deploying those pieces of your setup.

To test that your transformations all work before deploying, you can run
"rake rubber:config" in a development env.  This will transform all your
rubber config files into RAILS_ROOT/tmp/rubber as if it were "/" on your 
remote servers.

CONFIGURATION:

Config files are just ERB templates.  There are some special variables that
need to be set at the top of the config template file that control what
happens when the template is transformed:

@path       The output path to write the transformed config file to
@read_cmd   The command to use for reading the original config file from
            e.g. "crontab -l"
@write_cmd  The command to use for piping the transformed config file to
            e.g. "crontab -"
@post       The command to run after generating the config file ONLY if it
            has changed
@owner      The owner the output file should have, e.g. "root"
@group      The group the output file should have, e.g. "system"
@perms      The permissions the output file should have, e.g. 0644
@additive   Sets transformation to be additive, only replaces between given
            delimiters, e.g. @additive = ["## start", "## end"]

Of the above, the only variables that are required are  @path or both
@read_cmd and @write_cmd

In addition, within the config templates you have access to the rubber
configuration objects rubber_env (rubber*.yml) and rubber_instances
(instance*.yml).  This makes it possible to write config files in such a way
that adding more instances gets handled automatically - e.g. the proxy
destinations in the nginx.conf need to get updated when we add more app server
instances.  Look at existing config files for examples of using these two
configuration objects.

Configuration files that exist in config/rubber/common will be transformed for
all hosts.
Configuration files that exist in config/rubber/role/<role_name> will only be
transformed on the hosts that are members of role_name.
Configuration files that exist in config/rubber/host/<host_name> will only be
transformed on the hosts with a hostname of host_name.

All the variables used in the config files (and the rubber runtime) are
determined by combining all the settings in rubber.yml as well as the
settings in rubber-MODULE.yml which contains settings specific to each
MODULE (nginx, mongrel, etc)

When combining host/role/global variables in rubber*.yml, scalar (strings,
ints) values are overidden by more specific values, that is for the same
variable name in all three, the one in host takes precendence followed by
role then global.  Non-scalar values (sequences, maps) are merged when
combining roles, with keys in maps getting overridden by the more specific
ones when there is a conflict.  There currently is no way to override a
non-scalar for a more specific group, but I actually haven't needed that
capability yet.  You can also refer to other variables within the file like
so 'foo: "#{app_name}"'.  You are also allowed to execute arbitrary ruby
code in the #{} blocks.

RUNNING:

Once rubber is installed and configured for your project, the workflow
is as follows:

Create instance(s)
Bootstrap instance(s)
cap deploy(:cold)
Rinse, Repeat

Since bootstrap runs for all roles/hosts, not just the newly created ones, I
tried to make it safe for repeat executions on existing instances.  However,
you should probably verify that this is the case for your setup before
trusting it on a production system.

Note that if you change a config file template, and are using a real scm
provider for capistrano (like svn), you need to check it in before
rubber:config will be able to see the change on remote hosts.  One should use
the noscm scm provider for capistrano to iterate rapidly when building out a
deployment scenario with rubber.

I recommend that people use nettica for managing their DNS because they have a 
completely scriptable API for adding/removing instances from DNS which I have
integrated into rubber (thats what I use).  There is also limited support for
dyndns (basically any service that has a url for mapping hosts->IPs using basic
http auth), but I don't use it so no guarantees on how well it works.
 
EXTEND:

It should be safe to edit the generated files because the rails generate
script will warn of conflicts on subsequent runs, and allow you to perform
a diff for resolving the conflict.  However, for deployment scripts, there
is a lot you can do by tying into the existing process flow by using the
capistrano before/after mechanism.  For example,

after "rubber:install_packages", "custom_install"
before "rubber:install_packages", "custom_install_web"

# run for all roles
task :custom_install do
  sudo_script <<-SCRIPT
    run_cmd
    other_cmd
    ! cmd_that_can_have_non-zero_exit
  SCRIPT
end

# only run for web roles
task :custom_install_web, :roles => :web do
  put(File.read("local/file"), "/some/file")
end

If anyone has any configuration templates similar to what is provided in
generators/vulcanize/templates, please contribute them to the project,
e.g. a module for using apache instead of nginx, or postgres instead of
mysql, etc.

Enjoy!
