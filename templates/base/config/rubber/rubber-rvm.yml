# For MRI & ree (if you wish to use it) you will need:
#   aptitude install curl bison build-essential zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libreadline5-dev libxml2-dev git-core
# For IronRuby (if you wish to use it) you will need:

# REQUIRED: the version of rvm itself
rvm_version: 1.10.2

# REQUIRED: Set to the rvm version string for the ruby version you wish to use
# Run "rvm list known" to see the list of possible options
rvm_ruby: 1.9.3-p0

# REQUIRED: Set to version of RubyGems you want RVM to install. Note that older RVMs do not
# know about newer RubyGems.  So you may need to bump your rvm_version to get the latest RubyGems release.
rubygems_version: 1.8.15

# REQUIRED: Set to version of rake you want RVM to install.
rake_version: 0.9.2.2

# When rvm is installed as root, and you set the default, it symlinks ruby executables
# into /usr/local/rvm
ruby_prefix: /usr/local/rvm

rvm_prefix: /usr/local/rvm
  
# lets us setup global environment to use rvm (also needed when running sudo)
rvm_prepare: "source #{rvm_prefix}/scripts/rvm"

# dirty hack to get the rvm gem home rather than bundler gem home
# When we run rubber:config it loads rails/bundler, which forces the bundler gem home, yet deployment only gems
# like passenger need to be installed in rvm gem home rather than bundler
