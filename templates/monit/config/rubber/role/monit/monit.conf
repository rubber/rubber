## Bellow is the example of some frequently used statements. For information
## about the control file, a complete list of statements and options please
## have a look in the monit manual.

###############################################################################
## Global section
###############################################################################
##
## Start monit in background (run as daemon) and check the services at 2-minute
## intervals.
#
# set daemon 120
set daemon 60

#
#
## Set syslog logging with the 'daemon' facility. If the FACILITY option is
## omited, monit will use 'user' facility by default. You can specify the
## path to the file for monit native logging.
#
# set logfile syslog facility log_daemon
set logfile /var/log/monit.log
#
#
## Set list of mailservers for alert delivery. Multiple servers may be
## specified using comma separator. By default monit uses port 25 - it is
## possible to override it with the PORT option.
#
# set mailserver mail.bar.baz,               # primary mailserver
#                backup.bar.baz port 10025,  # backup mailserver on port 10025
#                localhost                   # fallback relay
#
set mailserver localhost

#
## By default monit will drop the event alert, in the case that there is no
## mailserver available. In the case that you want to keep the events for
## later delivery retry, you can use the EVENTQUEUE statement. The base
## directory where undelivered events will be stored is specified by the
## BASEDIR option. You can limit the maximal queue size using the SLOTS
## option (if omited then the queue is limited just by the backend filesystem).
#
# set eventqueue
#     basedir /var/monit  # set the base directory where events will be stored
#     slots 100           # optionaly limit the queue size
#
#
## Monit by default uses the following alert mail format:
##
## --8<--
## From: monit@$HOST                         # sender
## Subject: monit alert --  $EVENT $SERVICE  # subject
##
## $EVENT Service $SERVICE                   #
##                                           #
##      Date:        $DATE                   #
##      Action:      $ACTION                 #
##      Host:        $HOST                   # body
##      Description: $DESCRIPTION            #
##                                           #
## Your faithful employee,                   #
## monit                                     #
## --8<--
##
## You can override the alert message format or its parts such as subject
## or sender using the MAIL-FORMAT statement. Macros such as $DATE, etc.
## are expanded on runtime. For example to override the sender:
#
# set mail-format { from: monit@foo.bar }
#
#
## You can set the alert recipients here, which will receive the alert for
## each service. The event alerts may be restricted using the list.
#
# set alert sysadm@foo.bar                       # receive all alerts
# set alert manager@foo.bar only on { timeout }  # receive just service-
#                                                # timeout alert

# excluding instance, changed
set alert <%= rubber_env.admin_email %> only on {
      connection
      checksum
      data
      exec
      gid
      icmp
      invalid
      nonexist
      permission
      resource
      size
      timeout
      timestamp
      uid
}

#
#
## Monit has an embedded webserver, which can be used to view the
## configuration, actual services parameters or manage the services using the
## web interface.
#
# set httpd port 2812 and
#     use address localhost  # only accept connection from localhost
#     allow localhost        # allow localhost to connect to the server and
#     allow admin:monit      # require user 'admin' with password 'monit'
#

  tools_server = rubber_instances.for_role('web_tools').first.internal_ip rescue "127.0.0.1"
%>
set httpd port <%= rubber_env.monit_admin_port %>
  allow <%= tools_server %>

## Services
###############################################################################
##
## Check the general system resources such as load average, cpu and memory
## usage. Each rule specifies the tested resource, the limit and the action
## which will be performed in the case that the test failed.
#
#  check system myhost.mydomain.tld
#    if loadavg (1min) > 4 then alert
#    if loadavg (5min) > 2 then alert
#    if memory usage > 75% then alert
#    if cpu usage (user) > 70% then alert
#    if cpu usage (system) > 30% then alert
#    if cpu usage (wait) > 20% then alert
#
#
## Check a file for existence, checksum, permissions, uid and gid. In addition
## to the recipients in the global section, customized alert will be send to
## the additional recipient. The service may be grouped using the GROUP option.
#
#  check file apache_bin with path /usr/local/apache/bin/httpd
#    if failed checksum and
#       expect the sum 8f7f419955cefa0b33a2ba316cba3659 then unmonitor
#    if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid root then unmonitor
#    if failed gid root then unmonitor
#    alert security@foo.bar on {
#           checksum, permission, uid, gid, unmonitor
#        } with the mail-format { subject: Alarm! }
#    group server
#
#
## Check that a process is running, responding on the HTTP and HTTPS request,
## check its resource usage such as cpu and memory, number of childrens.
## In the case that the process is not running, monit will restart it by
## default. In the case that the service was restarted very often and the
## problem remains, it is possible to disable the monitoring using the
## TIMEOUT statement. The service depends on another service (apache_bin) which
## is defined in the monit control file as well.
#
#  check process apache with pidfile /usr/local/apache/logs/httpd.pid
#    start program = "/etc/init.d/httpd start"
#    stop program  = "/etc/init.d/httpd stop"
#    if cpu > 60% for 2 cycles then alert
#    if cpu > 80% for 5 cycles then restart
#    if totalmem > 200.0 MB for 5 cycles then restart
#    if children > 250 then restart
#    if loadavg(5min) greater than 10 for 8 cycles then stop
#    if failed host www.tildeslash.com port 80 protocol http
#       and request "/monit/doc/next.php"
#       then restart
#    if failed port 443 type tcpssl protocol http
#       with timeout 15 seconds
#       then restart
#    if 3 restarts within 5 cycles then timeout
#    depends on apache_bin
#    group server
#
#
## Check the device permissions, uid, gid, space and inode usage. Other
## services such as databases may depend on this resource and automatical
## graceful stop may be cascaded to them before the filesystem will become
## full and the data will be lost.
#
#  check device datafs with path /dev/sdb1
#    start program  = "/bin/mount /data"
#    stop program  = "/bin/umount /data"
#    if failed permission 660 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid root then unmonitor
#    if failed gid disk then unmonitor
#    if space usage > 80% for 5 times within 15 cycles then alert
#    if space usage > 99% then stop
#    if inode usage > 30000 then alert
#    if inode usage > 99% then stop
#    group server
#
#
## Check a file's timestamp: when it becomes older then 15 minutes, the
## file is not updated and something is wrong. In the case that the size
## of the file exceeded given limit, perform the script.
#
#  check file database with path /data/mydatabase.db
#    if failed permission 700 then alert
#    if failed uid data then alert
#    if failed gid data then alert
#    if timestamp > 15 minutes then alert
#    if size > 100 MB then exec "/my/cleanup/script"
#
#
## Check the directory permission, uid and gid.  An event is triggered
## if the directory does not belong to the user with the  uid 0 and
## the gid 0.  In the addition the permissions have to match the octal
## description of 755 (see chmod(1)).
#
#  check directory bin with path /bin
#    if failed permission 755 then unmonitor
#    if failed uid 0 then unmonitor
#    if failed gid 0 then unmonitor
#
#
## Check the remote host network services availability and the response
## content.  One of three pings, a successfull connection to a port and
## application level network check is performed.
#
#  check host myserver with address 192.168.1.1
#    if failed icmp type echo count 3 with timeout 3 seconds then alert
#    if failed port 3306 protocol mysql with timeout 15 seconds then alert
#    if failed url
#       http://user:password@www.foo.bar:8080/?querystring
#       and content == 'action="j_security_check"'
#       then alert
