# REQUIRED: the domain all the instances should be associated with

# OPTIONAL: See rubber-dns.yml for dns configuration
# This lets rubber update a dynamic dns service with the instance alias
# and ip when they are created.  It also allows setting up arbitrary
# dns records (CNAME, MX, Round Robin DNS, etc)

# OPTIONAL: Additional rubber file to pull config from if it exists.  This file will

    #
    # NOTE: for some reason Capistrano requires you to have both the public and
    # the private key in the same folder, the public key should have the
    # extension ".pub".  The easiest way to get your hand on this is to create the

    #
    key_name: gsg-keypair
    key_file: "#{Dir[(File.expand_path('~') rescue '/root') + '/.ec2/*' + cloud_providers.aws.key_name].first}"

    # OPTIONAL: EC2 spot instance request support.
    #
    # Enables the creation of spot instance requests.  Rubber will wait synchronously until the request is fulfilled,
    # at which point it will begin initializing the instance, unless spot_instance_request_timeout is set.

    #
    # The maximum price you would like to pay for your spot instance.
    # spot_price: "0.085"

# REQUIRED the cloud provider to use
#
cloud_provider: aws

# OPTIONAL: Define security groups
# Each security group is a name associated with a sequence of maps where the
# keys are the parameters to the ec2 AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress API

# ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ip

        from_port: 22
        to_port: 22
        source_ips: [0.0.0.0/0]

# OPTIONAL: The default security groups to create instances with
assigned_security_groups: [default]

# OPTIONAL: Automatically create security groups for each host and role
# EC2 doesn't allow one to change what groups an instance belongs to after
# creation, so its good to have some empty ones predefined.
auto_security_groups: true

# OPTIONAL: Automatically isolate security groups for each appname/environment
# by mangling their names to be appname_env_groupname
# This makes it safer to have staging and production coexist on the same EC2
# account, or even multiple apps
isolate_security_groups: true

# OPTIONAL: Prompts one to sync security group rules when the ones in amazon
# differ from those in rubber
prompt_for_security_group_sync: true

# OPTIONAL: The packages to install on all instances
# You can install a specific version of a package by using a sub-array of pkg, version
# For example, packages: [[rake, 0.7.1], irb]
packages: [postfix, build-essential, git-core, ec2-ami-tools]

# OPTIONAL: gem sources to setup for rubygems
# gemsources: ["http://rubygems.org", "http://gems.github.com"]

# OPTIONAL: The gems to install on all instances
# You can install a specific version of a gem by using a sub-array of gem, version
# For example, gem: [[rails, 2.2.2], open4, aws-s3]
gems: [open4, aws-s3, bundler, [rubber, "#{Rubber.version}"]]

# OPTIONAL: A string prepended to shell command strings that cause multi
# statement shell commands to fail fast.  You may need to comment this out
# on some platforms, but it works for me on linux/osx with a bash shell
#
stop_on_error_cmd: "function error_exit { exit 99; }; trap error_exit ERR"

# OPTIONAL: The default set of roles to use when creating a staging instance
# with "cap rubber:create_staging".  By default this uses all the known roles,
# but this is not always desired for staging, so you can specify a different
# set here
#
staging_roles: "web,app,db:primary=true"


# OPTIONAL: Lets one assign amazon elastic IPs (static IPs) to your instances
#           You should typically set this on the role/host level rather than
#           globally , unless you really do want all instances to have a
#           static IP
#
# use_static_ip: true

# OPTIONAL: Specifies an instance to be created in the given availability zone
#           Availability zones are sepcified by amazon to be somewhat isolated
#           from each other so that hardware failures in one zone shouldn't
#           affect instances in another.  As such, it is good to specify these
#           for instances that need to be redundant to reduce your chance of
#           downtime. You should typically set this on the role/host level
#           rather than globally.  Use cap rubber:describe_zones to see the list
#           of zones
# availability_zone: us-east-1a

# OPTIONAL: If you want t use Elastic Block Store (EBS) persistent
# volumes, add them to host specific overrides and they will get created
# and assigned to the instance.  On initial creation, the volume will get
# attached _and_ formatted, but if your host disapears and you recreate
# it, the volume will only get remounted thereby preserving your data
#
# hosts:
#   my_host:
#     availability_zone: us-east-1a
#     volumes:
#       - size: 100 # size of vol in GBs

#         mount: /mnt/logs # The directory to mount this volume to
#         filesystem: ext3 # the filesystem to create on volume

#    local_volumes:
#      - partition_device: /dev/sdb
#        zero: false # zeros out disk for improved performance
#      - partition_device: /dev/sdc
#        zero: false # zeros out disk for improved performance
#
#     # for raid array, you'll need to add mdadm to packages.  Likewise,
#     # xfsprogs is needed for xfs filesystem support
#     packages: [xfsprogs, mdadm]
#     raid_volumes:
#       - device: /dev/md0 # OS device to to create raid array on
#         mount: /mnt/fast # The directory to mount this array to
#         filesystem: xfs # the filesystem to create on array
#         filesystem_opts: -f # the filesystem opts in mkfs
#         raid_level: 0 # the raid level to use for the array
#         source_devices: [/dev/sdx, /dev/sdy] # the source EBS devices we are creating raid array from
#
#     # for LVM volumes, you'll need to add lvm2 to packages.  Likewise,
#     # xfsprogs is needed for xfs filesystem support
#     packages: [xfsprogs, lvm2]
#     lvm_volume_groups:
#       - name: vg # The volume group name
#         physical_volumes: [/dev/sdx, /dev/sdy] # Devices used for LVM group (you can use just one, but you can't stripe then)
#         extent_size: 32 # Size of the volume extent in MB
#         volumes:
#           - name: lv # Name of the logical volume
#             size: 999.9 # Size of volume in GB (slightly less than sum of all physical volumes because LVM reserves some space)
#             stripes: 2 # Count of stripes for volume
#             filesystem: xfs # The filesystem to create on the logical volume
#             filesystem_opts: -f # the filesystem opts in mkfs
#             mount: /mnt/large_work_dir # The directory to mount this LVM volume to

# OPTIONAL: You can also define your own variables here for use when
# transforming config files, and they will be available in your config
# templates as  <%= rubber_env.var_name %>
#
# var_name: var_value

# All variables can also be overridden on the role and/or host level by creating
# a sub level to the config under roles and hosts
# e.g. to install mysql only on db role, and awstats only on web01:

# OPTIONAL: Role specific overrides
# roles:
#   somerole:
#     packages: []
#   somerole2:
#     myconfig: someval

# OPTIONAL: Host specific overrides
# hosts:
#   somehost:
#     packages: []
