2.7.3 (02/12/2014)

Improvements:
============

[core] Be more aggressive about saving iptables rules to guard against unexpected shutdowns. <9c62aa1>


2.7.2 (02/12/2014)

*SECURITY WARNING*: Versions of rubber prior to this release will not save your iptables rules.  Upon reboot of your
server, it will load with a clear set of rules, effectively making every port on your server publicly accessible.

Who is affected?

Anyone not using EC2.  The EC2 code path uses EC2 security groups.  All other providers use iptables.

How do I fix it?

Upgrade to rubber 2.7.2 and run `cap rubber:setup_security_groups`, which will both refresh the iptables rules and
set up the files needed to persist and releoad rules.
