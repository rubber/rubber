# All variables can also be overridden on the role and/or host level by creating
# a sub level to the config under roles and hosts
# e.g. to install mysql only on db role, and awstats only on web01:
#
# packages: [ruby]
# roles:
#   db:
#     packages: [mysql]
# hosts:
#   web01:
#     packages: [awstats]

# REQUIRED: The name of your application
app_name: your_app_name

# REQUIRED: Notification emails (e.g. monit) get sent to this address
#
admin_email: root@localhost

# REQUIRED: The timezone the server should be in
timezone: US/Eastern

# REQUIRED: the domain all the instances should be associated with
#
domain: foo.com

# OPTIONAL: The provider(nettica|dyndns)/username/password for updating a dynamic dns service with the instance alias and ip
#
dns_provider:
dns_user:
dns_password:
dns_ttl:

# OPTIONAL: Additional rubber file to pull config from if it exists.  This file will
# also be pushed to remote host at RAILS_ROOT/config/rubber/rubber-secret.yml
#
# rubber_secret: "#{File.expand_path('~') + '/.ec2' + (RAILS_ENV == 'production' ? '' : '_dev') + '/rubber-secret.yml' rescue ''}"

# REQUIRED The amazon keys and account ID (digits only, no dashes) used to access the AWS API
#
aws_access_key: XXX
aws_secret_access_key: YYY
aws_account: ZZZ

# REQUIRED:  The name of the amazon keypair and location of its private key
#
# NOTE: for some reason Capistrano requires you to have both the public and
# the private key in the same folder, the public key should have the
# extension ".pub".  The easiest (only?) way to get your hand on this is to
# create an instance, ssh into it, and copy the file /mnt/openssh_id.pub
#
ec2_key_name: gsg-keypair
ec2_key_file: "#{Dir[(File.expand_path('~') rescue '/root') + '/.ec2/*' + ec2_key_name].first}"

# OPTIONAL: Needed for bundling a running instance using rubber:bundle
#
# ec2_pk_file: "#{Dir[(File.expand_path('~') rescue '/root') + '/.ec2/pk-*'].first}"
# ec2_cert_file: "#{Dir[(File.expand_path('~') rescue '/root') + '/.ec2/cert-*'].first}"
# ec2_image_bucket: "#{app_name}_images"

# OPTIONAL: Needed for backing up database to s3
# ec2_backup_bucket: "#{app_name}_backups"

# REQUIRED: the ami and instance type for creating instances
# The Ubuntu images at http://alestic.com/ work well
# Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy	base install	32-bit	2.6.21	ami-51709438
# Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Hardy	base install	64-bit	2.6.21	ami-4f709426
#
ec2_instance: ami-51709438
# m1.small or m1.large or m1.xlarge
ec2_instance_type: m1.small

# OPTIONAL: Define ec2 security groups
# Each security group is a name associated with a sequence of maps where the
# keys are the parameters to the ec2 AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress API
# source_security_group_name, source_security_group_owner_id
# ip_protocol, from_port, to_port, cidr_ip
#
ec2_security_groups:
  default:
    description: The default security group
    rules:
      - source_security_group_name: default
        source_security_group_owner_id: "#{aws_account}"
      - ip_protocol: tcp
        from_port: 22
        to_port: 22
        cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0

# OPTIONAL: The default security groups to create instances with
security_groups: [default]

# OPTIONAL: Automatically create security groups for each host and role
# EC2 doesn't allow one to change what groups an instance belongs to after
# creation, so its good to have some empty ones predefined.
auto_security_groups: true

# OPTIONAL: The packages to install on all instances
packages: [build-essential, ruby-full, ruby1.8-dev, rake, irb, subversion]

# OPTIONAL: The gems to install on all instances
gems: [rails, open4, aws-s3]

# OPTIONAL: A string prepended to shell command strings that cause multi
# statement shell commands to fail fast.  You may need to comment this out
# on some platforms, but it works for me on linux/osx with a bash shell
#
stop_on_error_cmd: "function error_exit { exit 99; }; trap error_exit ERR"

# OPTIONAL: The default set of roles to use when creating a staging instance
# with "cap rubber:create_staging".  By default this uses all the known roles,
# but this is not always desired for staging, so you can specify a different
# set here
#
staging_roles: "web,haproxy,app,mysql_master"


# OPTIONAL: Lets one assign amazon elastic IPs (static IPs) to your instances
#           You should typically set this on the role/host level rather than
#           globally , unless you really do want all instances to have a
#           static IP
#
# use_static_ip: true

# OPTIONAL: Specifies an instance to be created in the given availability zone
#           Availability zones are sepcified by amazon to be somewhat isolated
#           from each other so that hardware failures in one zone shouldn't
#           affect instances in another.  As such, it is good to specify these
#           for instances that need to be redundant to reduce your chance of
#           downtime. You should typically set this on the role/host level
#           rather than globally.  Use rubber describe:zones to see the list
#           of zones
# availability_zone: us-east-1a

# OPTIONAL: You can also define your own variables here for use when
# transforming config files, and they will be available in your config
# templates as  <%= rubber_env.var_name %>
#
# var_name: var_value

# OPTIONAL: Role specific overrides
# roles:
#   somerole:
#     packages: []
#   somerole2:
#     myconfig: someval

# OPTIONAL: Host specific overrides
# hosts:
#   somehost:
#     packages: []
